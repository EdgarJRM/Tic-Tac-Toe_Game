# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game
# Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a program written in C# using Visual Studio

The program was created by integrating GitHub and Visual Studio with object-oriented programming.

This game was created with the intention of learning C# to start programming video games but learning to handle the C# base as best as possible before using a video game engine.

# Future Work
- I want to improve so that instead of saving the winner of each game, the best 10 scores are saved from highest to lowest.
- Maybe change it so that instead of displaying "X" and "O" in text, it's a striking image. It could perhaps be imported by the user if desired.
- Fix text color loss after first game
